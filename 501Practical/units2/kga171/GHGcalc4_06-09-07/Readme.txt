Readme file for GHGcalc3 Calculator.

The normal (Freeware) disclaimer applies; the user accepts responsibility for the use of the program, we take no responsibility for damage to your system during its use.


To operate correctly, all these files should reside in the same folder/drawer/sub-directory:

	GHGcalc4.exe	The program.
	GHGcalc4.chm	The compiled HTML help file (default help file format).
	GHGcalc4.hlp	The WinHelp file (alternate help file format).
	GHGcalc4.cnt	The WinHelp contents file.
		(If the above four are not in the same folder, the program will be unable to locate the Help file)
		
	Readme.txt	This file (not required for correct operation of the program).


Due to newer versions of Windows no longer using WinHelp, GHGcalc still gives the option of viewing in that format. However (though included) the WinHelp file is no longer being updated and may not contain complete documentation on this version of GHGcalc.

GHGcalc was designed to fill a screen at a resolution of 800 x 600, but should still work in other resolutions. It was programmed in Delphi6 on Windows XP, but should run OK on other Windows OS'.

Though the program does run under Vista you may find the program help file does not. This is due to the security aspects of the OS. Two options exist: either download and install a copy of WinHelp32 from microsoft (to view the help file in WinHelp format), or install a chm fix (to view the help file in compiled HTML format).


To use GHGcalc; double-click GHGcalc4.exe


Data entry boxes have drop-down hints attached, to provide information on what data is required. For further information go to the Help menu at top left of screen.

To Exit; either click "Exit" in the drop-down "File" menu at top left, or click the close (X) icon in top right corner of screen.

Printing of results is very basic (see Results, in the Help file).
Alternatively use Alt + PrintScreen to save the screen to clipboard, then Paste into a graphics-program (eg. IrfanView), or word-processor (eg. Word). Print using its options.
