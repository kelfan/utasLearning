Before looking at edges...
The array for the find operation:
find_array[0] = 0
find_array[1] = 1
find_array[2] = 2
find_array[3] = 3
find_array[4] = 4
find_array[5] = 5
find_array[6] = 6
The sets in the array of linked lists:
set 0 is of size 1 and contains: 0 
set 1 is of size 1 and contains: 1 
set 2 is of size 1 and contains: 2 
set 3 is of size 1 and contains: 3 
set 4 is of size 1 and contains: 4 
set 5 is of size 1 and contains: 5 
set 6 is of size 1 and contains: 6 

Looking at edge of weight 2 between vertices 0 and 4
Adding edge does not give cycle,
as vertex 0 is in set 0,
and vertex 4 is in set 4,
so add the edge
0 4 2
and union sets 0 and 4
After union operation...

Looking at edge of weight 4 between vertices 1 and 3
Adding edge does not give cycle,
as vertex 1 is in set 1,
and vertex 3 is in set 3,
so add the edge

set 5 is of size 1 and contains: 5 
set 6 is of size 1 and contains: 6 

Looking at edge of weight 5 between vertices 0 and 2
Adding edge does not give cycle,
as vertex 0 is in set 4,
and vertex 2 is in set 2,
so add the edge
0 2 5
and union sets 4 and 2

Looking at edge of weight 5 between vertices 0 and 3
Adding edge does not give cycle,
as vertex 0 is in set 4,
and vertex 3 is in set 3,
so add the edge
0 3 5

Looking at edge of weight 5 between vertices 0 and 6
Adding edge does not give cycle,
as vertex 0 is in set 4,
and vertex 6 is in set 6,
so add the edge
0 6 5
and union sets 4 and 6

set 5 is of size 1 and contains: 5 
set 6 is of size 0 and contains: 

Looking at edge of weight 5 between vertices 1 and 4
Adding edge would give cycle,
as vertices 1 and 4 are both in set 4.

Looking at edge of weight 6 between vertices 3 and 6
Adding edge would give cycle,
as vertices 3 and 6 are both in set 4.

Looking at edge of weight 9 between vertices 2 and 5
Adding edge does not give cycle,
as vertex 2 is in set 4,
and vertex 5 is in set 5,
so add the edge
2 5 9
and union sets 4 and 5
